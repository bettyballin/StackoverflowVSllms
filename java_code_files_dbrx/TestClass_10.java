        Thread.sleep(3000); // allow some time delay in between steps/commands typically used while automating tests via Selenium IDE and WebDriver respectively; this can be adjusted according to needs but usually 1-5 seconds works just fine generally speaking unless there are special use cases, e.g., AJAX calls etc., which need even more time delays during execution of individual test scripts.
        // More steps would go here correspondingly based upon specific project requirements or user actions/activities as part of the tests being run and validated for correctness; this includes clicking any buttons, filling in forms and pressing submit afterwards, or logging into certain areas of a web application with registered users credentials etc., whichever applies to your particular scenario/business case at hand.
