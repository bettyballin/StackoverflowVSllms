    // Unfortunately, there are not many third-party ADO.NET providers for Oracle database that fully support Oracle Object Types besides the ones you already mentioned: Oracle Data Provider for .Net (ODP.NET) and dotConnect from Devart.
    
    // However, I can offer an alternative approach to deal with this limitation and improve performance by using a middleware like AutoMapper or manual mapping between object types and plain classes that represent them in your application logic.
    
    // The idea is to retrieve the data you need from Oracle database without any complex objects (like geometries) which are causing issues, map these data into plain classes using either AutoMapper or manually coding mapper functions and then use those mapped instances for further processing in the business layer of your application. In this way, you can reduce the dependencies on specific third-party drivers that directly work with Oracle Object Types and avoid possible performance degradation due to their limitations.
