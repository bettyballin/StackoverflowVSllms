// The class also can be used to get similarity level between two image of the same size, which can be useful to get information about how different/similar are images:\n// Create template matching algorithm's instance\n\n// Use zero similarity to make sure algorithm will provide anything\nExhaustiveTemplateMatching tm = new ExhaustiveTemplateMatching(0);\n\n// Compare two images\nTemplateMatch[] matchings = tm.ProcessImage( image1, image2 );\n\n// Check similarity level\nif (matchings[0].Similarity > 0.95)\n{\n    // Do something with quite similar images\n}
