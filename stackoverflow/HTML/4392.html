This transition had many casualties like Lotus 1-2-3 (which was basically killed by Excel on Windows) and Wordperfect (MS Word killed it). Now you can argue that MS had the inside track since they also produced Windows and you'd be right but beyond that I think MS adjusted to the change quicker than anyone else.</p>\n<p>Borland was still an agile little company back then. It adjusted and took its highly successful Turbo Pascal and created Delphi.</p>\n<div class="sidenote-left"><div>See Chapter 7 for further explanation</div></div>\n<p>Now truly compiled languages ruled the roost in the 1990s with the exception of one little upstart: Java, which was something basically new. It was sorta compiled, sorta interpreted (being compiled into machine-independent bytecode that ran on a virtual machine). I personally think that the rise of both Java and Netscape scared the absolute bejesus out of Microsoft in the late 90s.</p>\n<div class="sidenote-right"><div>See Chapter 9 for further explanation</div></div>\n<p>Borland adjusted reasonably well producing what was really the first really successful Java IDE in JBuilder.</p>\n<p>They were fending off a resurgent Microsoft who also produced successive versions of Visual Studio that (imho) were years ahead of their time in the late 90s. I can remember coding Visual C++ with MTS (microsoft Transaction Server) DCOM objects over 10 years ago and that was a precursor to the modern application server platform we have today. Remote debugging and the like were things that were (or at least seemed) light years ahead on Visual Studio.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</body>\n</html>
