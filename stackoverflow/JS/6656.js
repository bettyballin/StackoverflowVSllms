var f1 = function() { return 1; }; // 'f1' holds the function itself, not the value '1'\nvar f2 = function() { return 1; }(); // 'f2' holds the value '1' because we're executing it with the parenthesis after the function definition\n\nvar a = f1(); // we are now executing the function 'f1' which return value will be assigned to 'a'\nvar b = f2(); // we are executing 'f2' which is the value 1. We can only execute functions so this won't work
