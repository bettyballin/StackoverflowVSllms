// The following line is used to disable a specific warning.
// However, since you're using GCC, the syntax might differ.
// For GCC, you would use #pragma GCC diagnostic ignored "-Wunused-variable" for example.
// Here, we're just including it for the sake of the example, but it won't actually do anything with GCC.

// #pragma warning(disable : 4006) // MSVC syntax, not applicable to GCC

// Minimal C program
