' 1. Define an Interface\nPublic Interface IStreamWrapper\n    Function Read(buffer As Byte(), offset As Integer, count As Integer) As Integer\n    Sub Write(buffer As Byte(), offset As Integer, count As Integer)\n    ' Add other methods as needed\nEnd Interface\n\n' 2. Implement Wrapper Class\nPublic Class StreamWrapper Implements IStreamWrapper\n    Private _stream As Stream\n\n    Public Sub New(stream As Stream)\n        _stream = stream\n    End Sub\n\n    Public Function Read(buffer As Byte(), offset As Integer, count As Integer) As Integer Implements IStreamWrapper.Read\n        Return _stream.Read(buffer, offset, count)\n    End Function\n\n    Public Sub Write(buffer As Byte(), offset As Integer, count As Integer) Implements IStreamWrapper.Write\n        _stream.Write(buffer, offset, count)\n    End Sub\n\n    ' Implement other methods as needed\nEnd Class\n\n' 3. Modify Method to Accept Interface\nPublic Sub Initialize(ByVal uploadStream As IStreamWrapper)\n    ''// Logic using uploadStream\n    Dim buffer(1024) As Byte\n    Dim bytesRead As Integer = uploadStream.Read(buffer, 0, buffer.Length)\n\n    ' Process bytesRead and buffer as needed\nEnd Sub\n\n' 4. Create Mock Implementation\nPublic Class MockStreamWrapper Implements IStreamWrapper\n    Public Property Data As List(Of Byte)\n    Private _position As Integer\n\n    Public Sub New()\n        _position = 0\n        Data = New List(Of Byte)()\n    End Sub\n\n    Public Function Read(buffer As Byte(), offset As Integer, count As Integer) As Integer Implements IStreamWrapper.Read\n        Dim bytesRead As Integer = Math.Min(count, Data.Count - _position)\n        For i As Integer = 0 To bytesRead - 1\n            buffer(offset + i) = Data(_position + i)\n        Next\n        _position += bytesRead\n        Return bytesRead\n    End Function\n\n    Public Sub Write(buffer As Byte(), offset As Integer, count As Integer) Implements IStreamWrapper.Write\n        For i As Integer = 0 To count - 1\n            Data.Add(buffer(offset + i))\n        Next\n    End Sub\n\n    ' Implement other methods as needed\nEnd Class
