<div style="font-family: monospace; white-space: pre-wrap; width: 300px;">\n    I came across an interesting problem today.  \n    I have a text email I'm sending from a Web page.  \n    I'm displaying a preview and wanted to put the preview in a fixed font retaining the white space since that's the way the plain text email will appear.\n</div>
