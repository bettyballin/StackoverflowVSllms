// Covariance example\nIEnumerable<string> strings = new List<string>();\nIEnumerable<object> objects = strings; // This is allowed because IEnumerable<T> is covariant\n\n// Contravariance example\nAction<object> objAction = (o) => { };\nAction<string> strAction = objAction as Action<string>; // This cast would not be allowed, but contravariance allows passing a delegate that takes object to where Action<string> is expected in method arguments.
