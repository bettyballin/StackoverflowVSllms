-- Assuming the current year is in the 2000s (e.g., 2023)\nSELECT ename FROM emp WHERE hiredate = TO_DATE('01/05/81', 'dd/mm/yy');\n-- This will return employees hired on January 5, 1981\n\nSELECT ename FROM emp WHERE hiredate = TO_DATE('01/05/81', 'dd/mm/rr');\n-- If the current year is between 2050 and 2099, this would look for January 5, 1981.\n-- But if the current year is before or equal to 2049, this will return no results\n-- because it would be looking for January 5, 2081 (incorrect year interpretation based on RR logic).
