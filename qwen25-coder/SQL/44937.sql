-- Consider the first query if simplicity and readability are priorities:\nSELECT result\n  FROM result_tbl\n  JOIN test_tbl USING (test_id)\n  JOIN sample_tbl USING (sample_id)\n  JOIN (SELECT request_id FROM request_tbl WHERE request_status='A') USING(request_id);\n\n-- Use second if reduced data volume is critical and confirmed to improve performance:\nSELECT result\n  FROM (SELECT result, test_id FROM result_tbl)\n  JOIN (SELECT test_id, sample_id FROM test_tbl) USING(test_id)\n  JOIN (SELECT sample_id FROM sample_tbl) USING(sample_id)\n  JOIN (SELECT request_id FROM request_tbl WHERE request_status='A') USING(request_id);
