-- Standard ANSI SELECT statement\nSELECT customer_id, first_name, last_name\nFROM customers\nWHERE country = 'USA'\nORDER BY last_name ASC;\n\n/*\nNotes:\n- 'AS' keyword for aliasing columns is optional in many implementations.\n- Quoting identifiers (e.g., "customer_id" vs. `customer_id`) can be different between systems.\n- Date literals like TIMESTAMP '2023-10-01 12:00:00 UTC' should be handled according to each DBMS's requirements.\n*/
