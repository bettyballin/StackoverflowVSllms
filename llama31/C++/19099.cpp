// In C++, it's safe to delete a NULL pointer, as the delete operator checks for NULL internally.\n// So, the check for NULL before deleting is redundant and can be omitted.\n\n// However, setting the pointer to NULL after deleting is a good practice to prevent:\n// 1. Double deletion: Deleting the same memory location twice can lead to undefined behavior.\n// 2. Dangling pointers: Pointers pointing to already deleted memory locations can cause issues.\n\n// So, the corrected and secure code would be:\n\ndelete pSomeObject;\npSomeObject = NULL;  // or nullptr in C++11/C++14/C++17
