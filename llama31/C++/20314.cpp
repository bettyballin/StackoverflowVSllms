// The ISupportErrorInfo interface is used to indicate whether an interface supports\n// the IErrorInfo interface, which provides detailed error information.\n\n// By implementing ISupportErrorInfo, an object can propagate error information\n// up the call chain correctly.\n\n// The InterfaceSupportsErrorInfo method takes a REFIID (a reference to an interface ID)\n// as input and returns an HRESULT indicating whether the interface supports IErrorInfo.\n\n// Returning S_OK from InterfaceSupportsErrorInfo indicates that the interface\n// supports IErrorInfo and can provide detailed error information.\n\n// You should return S_OK for interfaces that support IErrorInfo, and S_FALSE or\n// E_NOINTERFACE for interfaces that do not support IErrorInfo.\n\n// Example implementation:\nHRESULT STDMETHODCALLTYPE MyObject_InterfaceSupportsErrorInfo(REFIID riid)\n{\n    // Assume MyObject supports IErrorInfo for IID_IMyInterface\n    if (riid == IID_IMyInterface)\n    {\n        return S_OK; // MyObject supports IErrorInfo for IID_IMyInterface\n    }\n    else\n    {\n        return S_FALSE; // MyObject does not support IErrorInfo for other interfaces\n    }\n}
