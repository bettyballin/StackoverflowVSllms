// PHP requires explicit reference to "$this" due to its dynamic nature and lack of scope resolution.\n// In PHP, variables and functions are looked up at runtime, rather than compile-time.\n\n// This is in contrast to languages like Java or C++, where the compiler can resolve symbols at compile-time.\n\n// To illustrate this, consider the following example:\nclass MyClass {\n    private $myVar;\n\n    public function myFunction() {\n        $myVar = 'local variable';\n        // Without explicit $this, PHP would look for a local variable or a global function.\n        // By using $this, we explicitly tell PHP to look for a member variable or function.\n        $this->myVar = 'member variable';\n        $this->myOtherFunction();\n    }\n\n    private function myOtherFunction() {\n        echo 'Hello, World!';\n    }\n}
