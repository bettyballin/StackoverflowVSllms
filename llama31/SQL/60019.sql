-- In Oracle, the maximum length of a table name is 30 bytes (not characters).\n\n-- The maximum length of a column name in Oracle is also 30 bytes.\n\n-- Note that this is bytes, not characters, so if you're using a multi-byte character set, \n-- the actual number of characters may be less than 30.\n\n-- Starting with Oracle 12cR2 (12.2), the maximum length of an identifier (such as a table or column name) \n-- has been increased to 128 bytes.
