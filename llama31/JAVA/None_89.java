// This is not Java code, but rather a mix of Java and PHP.
// The following is a revised version of the code, written entirely in Java.

public class None_89_89 {

        // The original PHP code has been replaced with a comment, as it is not compatible with Java.
        // To achieve similar functionality in Java, you would need to use Java's built-in string manipulation and database libraries.
        // Here is an example of how you might do this:

        // String clean = input.replaceAll("[^a-zA-Z0-9\\s]", "");
        // clean = clean.replace("`", "");
        // 
        // // Database escaping is typically handled by the JDBC driver or a library like Hibernate.
        // // Here's a simplified example using JDBC:
        // 
        // Connection conn = DriverManager.getConnection("url", "user", "password");
        // PreparedStatement stmt = conn.prepareStatement("SELECT * FROM table WHERE column = ?");
        // stmt.setString(1, clean);
    }
