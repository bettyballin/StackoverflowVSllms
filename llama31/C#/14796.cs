// The ToUniversalTime() method in C# converts a DateTime object to Coordinated Universal Time (UTC).\n// Here's how it works:\n\n// When you create a DateTime object, it is represented in the local time zone of the machine it's running on.\n// However, the DateTime struct also stores a DateTimeKind property, which can be one of three values:\n// - DateTimeKind.Unspecified: The time zone is not specified.\n// - DateTimeKind.Utc: The time is in UTC.\n// - DateTimeKind.Local: The time is in the local time zone.\n\n// When you call ToUniversalTime() on a DateTime object, .NET uses the following rules:\n// - If the DateTimeKind is Unspecified, it is assumed to be in the local time zone.\n// - If the DateTimeKind is Utc, no conversion is performed.\n// - If the DateTimeKind is Local, the conversion is performed based on the system's current time zone settings.\n\n// To demonstrate this, consider the following code:\n\nDateTime localDateTime = DateTime.Now; // DateTimeKind is Local\nDateTime utcDateTime = localDateTime.ToUniversalTime(); // converted to UTC\n\nConsole.WriteLine(localDateTime.Kind); // prints "Local"\nConsole.WriteLine(utcDateTime.Kind); // prints "Utc"\n\n// If you create a DateTime object in one time zone and then switch to another time zone,\n// the ToUniversalTime() method will still work correctly because it uses the time zone information\n// stored in the DateTime struct to perform the conversion.\n\n// However, if you manually change the time zone of the machine while the program is running,\n// you may get unexpected results. To handle this scenario, consider using the TimeZoneInfo class\n// or the DateTimeOffset struct, which can handle time zone changes more robustly.
