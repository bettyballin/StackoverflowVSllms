// Assuming ds is your DataSet and you want to remove a column by name\nds.Tables[0].Columns.Remove("ColumnName");\n\n// Or if you want to remove a column by index\nds.Tables[0].Columns.RemoveAt(1); // This removes the second column (index 1)\n\n// If you want to remove multiple columns, you would do so in a loop or individually\n// as Remove/RemoveAt does not accept multiple arguments for multiple removals.
