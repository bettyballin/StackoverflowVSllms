-- Assuming you have a list of employee codes\n-- Split them into multiple smaller lists, each containing fewer than 1000 codes\n\n-- First batch\nSELECT * FROM employees WHERE department = 'your_department' AND employee_code IN (...)\n-- Second batch\nSELECT * FROM employees WHERE department = 'your_department' AND employee_code IN (...)\n-- Continue for all batches\n\n-- Alternatively, use a temporary table or a join to handle larger datasets\n-- Example using a temporary table:\n\nCREATE TEMPORARY TABLE temp_employee_codes (employee_code VARCHAR(50));\n-- Insert all your employee codes into the temporary table\nINSERT INTO temp_employee_codes (employee_code) VALUES ('code1'), ('code2'), ...;\n\n-- Execute the query using a join\nSELECT e.* FROM employees e\nJOIN temp_employee_codes tec ON e.employee_code = tec.employee_code\nWHERE e.department = 'your_department';
