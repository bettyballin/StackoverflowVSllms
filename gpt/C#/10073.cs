// Assuming your DataSet is named 'MyDataSet' and the TableAdapter is 'PeopleTableAdapter'\n\n// First, create an instance of your DataSet and TableAdapter\nMyDataSet myDataSet = new MyDataSet();\nMyDataSetTableAdapters.PeopleTableAdapter peopleTableAdapter = new MyDataSetTableAdapters.PeopleTableAdapter();\n\n// Access the SqlCommand of the TableAdapter's specific query\nSystem.Data.SqlClient.SqlCommand command = peopleTableAdapter.CommandCollection[0]; // 0 is the index of the first command; adjust as necessary\n\n// Update the CommandText to the new query\ncommand.CommandText = "SELECT * FROM people WHERE age > 17";\n\n// Now you can use the TableAdapter with the updated query\npeopleTableAdapter.Fill(myDataSet.People);
